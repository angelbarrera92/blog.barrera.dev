&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/hyper-personalization.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about this before: AI isn’t a future promise, it’s our current reality. In previous posts we explored how it’s landing in our day-to-day (see &lt;a href="https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/en/ai-already-among-us/"&gt;AI. Already Among Us&lt;/a&gt;), but today I want to take it one step further. We’re entering the age of hyper-personalized software, and this is going to blow up the rules of the game as we know them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="generic-software"&gt;
Generic software
&lt;a href="#generic-software" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, we’ve adapted to software. We’ve built entire businesses around massive, generic tools: Jira, SAP, Salesforce, Stripe, or Trello. They’re engineering wonders, yes, but they have an intrinsic problem: one size fits all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For them to work in your business, you have to adapt to them. And that doesn’t just create operational friction, it also carries a huge cost. These platforms maintain massive infrastructures to be useful to millions of users, and that cost —direct and indirect— ends up landing on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bespoke-consulting"&gt;
Bespoke consulting
&lt;a href="#bespoke-consulting" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where AI moves the pieces. Until now, bespoke software was a slow and expensive luxury. But AI allows mid-sized companies and boutique consultancies to build specific solutions at a speed that was unthinkable before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why fight with the configuration of a generic CRM if you can have one designed exactly for your workflow in a fraction of the time? Software will no longer be a concrete block you have to adapt to, but a glove that’s woven &lt;strong&gt;in real time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="developer-role"&gt;
Developer role
&lt;a href="#developer-role" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift brings a mutation in roles that, personally, makes me a bit uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, we’ve valued developers for their technical specialization: the React expert, the COBOL “guru” who fixes impossible bugs, the database architect. But that “technical problem” is starting to disappear. If AI can find and fix a COBOL bug faster and cheaper than any expert consultant, what is the human’s value in the equation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value is no longer in the how (the code), but in the what and the why. The developer of the near future will have to stop looking only at syntax and start looking at product, service, and business impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-bottleneck"&gt;
New bottleneck
&lt;a href="#new-bottleneck" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In classic structures, there were layers of middle management dedicated to defining what to build, while the technical layers executed. It worked because cycles were long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if execution (development) becomes almost instantaneous thanks to AI, the bottleneck is no longer writing code, but definition. I foresee a drastic reduction of those middle layers. Management work will be optimized —or absorbed— by AI itself, forcing those who remain to be far more strategic and faster at validating ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="customer-dilemma"&gt;
Customer dilemma
&lt;a href="#customer-dilemma" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we move one step further and reach the end customer, we find a paradox. If it’s now easier, faster, and cheaper to create software, the market will be flooded with hyper-personalized options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As customers, are we prepared to receive that many inputs? How will we decide between one product and another when technical differentiation is minimal and the supply is infinite? Business validation will be faster than ever, but capturing the customer’s attention will be the ultimate challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;
Conclusion
&lt;a href="#conclusion" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re moving from a world where software was a rigid tool to one where it’s something far more flexible and moldable. Code is losing its value as an “asset” and becoming a “commodity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question I’m asking today is: if your professional value was based on solving technical problems that AI already solves in seconds, &lt;strong&gt;what’s your next move?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The consequences of not teaching children about delayed gratification</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/consequences-not-teaching-about-delayed-gratification/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/consequences-not-teaching-about-delayed-gratification/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/patient.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we navigate our increasingly complex and fast-paced world, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the instant gratification culture that surrounds us. With just a few clicks on our smartphones, we can access anything from entertainment to education. But what about our children? Are they being taught the importance of delayed gratification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many parents are not teaching their kids &lt;strong&gt;about the value of saving and waiting for things they want&lt;/strong&gt;. This lack of financial literacy can have far-reaching consequences, leading to a society that values immediate pleasure over long-term planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="buy-now-consume-later"&gt;
Buy now, consume later
&lt;a href="#buy-now-consume-later" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, it&amp;rsquo;s more important than ever to teach children about delayed gratification. With the rise of subscription-based services and pay-per-use models, &lt;strong&gt;our kids are constantly bombarded with offers to buy now and consume later&lt;/strong&gt;. This can lead to a culture of instant consumption, where the value of saving and planning for the future is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of not teaching children about delayed gratification are far-reaching. When kids learn that they can have anything they want instantly, they may become entitled or develop &lt;strong&gt;unrealistic expectations&lt;/strong&gt;. This can lead to problems with self-control, decision-making, and financial responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="finances"&gt;
Finances
&lt;a href="#finances" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the lack of financial literacy among children can have &lt;strong&gt;serious long-term effects on their economic well-being&lt;/strong&gt;. Studies have shown that individuals who are not financially literate are more likely to struggle with debt, savings, and retirement planning. These issues can have a significant impact on their overall quality of life and ability to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="what-can-we-do"&gt;
What can we do?
&lt;a href="#what-can-we-do" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what can parents do to teach children about delayed gratification? Here are some practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set clear expectations&lt;/strong&gt;: Establish clear rules and consequences for your child&amp;rsquo;s behavior, including the importance of saving and waiting for things they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model good behavior&lt;/strong&gt;: Show your child that you also value delayed gratification &lt;strong&gt;by practicing&lt;/strong&gt; what you preach. Demonstrate the benefits of saving and planning for the future by setting goals and achieving them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage goal-setting&lt;/strong&gt;: Help your child set short-term and long-term goals, and encourage them to work towards achieving those goals through savings and planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach the value of money&lt;/strong&gt;: Educate your child about the value of money and the importance of earning it. Encourage them to seek out opportunities for financial gain and teach them how to manage their earnings wisely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage patience and self-control&lt;/strong&gt;: Teach your child the importance of waiting and delaying gratification in order to achieve long-term goals. Encourage them to practice self-control and make smart decisions about spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="final-words"&gt;
Final words
&lt;a href="#final-words" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By teaching children about delayed gratification, we can help them develop &lt;em&gt;essential life skills&lt;/em&gt; that will serve them well into adulthood. By modeling good behavior, setting clear expectations, encouraging goal-setting, teaching the value of money, and encouraging patience and self-control, we can raise a generation of financially responsible individuals who are better equipped to navigate the challenges of the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IOT - Intelligent Devices</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/iot-intelligent-devices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/iot-intelligent-devices/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/iot-intelligent-devices.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered that my vacuum robot stopped working for more than three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not configure the vacuuming program, that is, I could not modify the cleaning plan to define the rooms to be cleaned nor modify the suction power that the application allows you to set &lt;strong&gt;and you cannot do it in any other way&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="then"&gt;
Then?
&lt;a href="#then" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, you can turn the robot on with the button on the device itself and it will perform the last run it was configured to do. Hopefully it will be the entire house at sufficient suction power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days, the app started working again&amp;hellip; but this gave me pause. We rely on third-party services when we buy certain products, such as robot vacuums, smart plugs, surveillance cameras, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation there are &lt;em&gt;(mainly)&lt;/em&gt; two groups of people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common people&lt;/strong&gt; who do not have to know these details and buy this kind of devices because they like or need them.
They think they can be a good solution for them, but in this kind of situations, the only thing they can do is to call the store where they bought it or call the manufacturer to manage the warranty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer scientists&lt;/strong&gt; or those of us who like to solve technological problems and understand how this type of devices work, i.e. we know that they connect to a remote server to send/receive data &lt;em&gt;(which we don&amp;rsquo;t usually like)&lt;/em&gt; and that we need to interact with them from inside and outside the home through an application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="surveillance-cameras"&gt;
Surveillance cameras
&lt;a href="#surveillance-cameras" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These also apply to surveillance cameras. The common use of a surveillance camera is to be able to see what is happening in the house in real time from anywhere. In addition, upon any event/movement to receive security notifications. For this we rely, implicitly, on external services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are users aware of how this works? If they knew that the images pass through a server of a company &lt;em&gt;(which may or may not be the manufacturer of the product)&lt;/em&gt;, the content is analyzed and stored in the cloud, would they buy it? Would they use it? Would they install it at home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general public does not have to know this detail, for most it is just an application which configures the surveillance camera and magically you can see what happens in your home from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;magic does not exist&lt;/strong&gt;, on this we all agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="alternatives"&gt;
Alternatives
&lt;a href="#alternatives" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a group of affected &lt;em&gt;(on telegram)&lt;/em&gt; and it turns out I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one&amp;hellip;. The reason was that the servers of this brand went down and was out of service during that weekend completely.
In this telegram group I discovered that there was a way by which to set up a compatible server on my own. This way, I would be the only one responsible for keeping the service running so I could use my robot vacuum cleaner and be able to configure it without having to depend on that third party company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several hours of reading information and after studying &lt;em&gt;(not trivial)&lt;/em&gt; how to access and re-configure &lt;em&gt;(root)&lt;/em&gt; the robot to use this new method, I finally got it working.
All this is only feasible if you are a computer scientist and like this kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="future"&gt;
Future
&lt;a href="#future" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the general public I foresee legal problems with warranties, ie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if your robot vacuum cleaner stops working?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if it stops giving you certain functionality if a company&amp;rsquo;s server stops working?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the company goes bankrupt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;o&amp;hellip; any other reason that makes you unable to use that application to configure your device?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there some kind of law that mandates that you have to support and provide services for at least the life of the device?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What responsibility does the company have to maintain the server or that service beyond a year or two years from the sale of the product?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, we could get to a point where your device is a paperweight, right? &lt;strong&gt;Even if it&amp;rsquo;s in good shape&lt;/strong&gt;.
There may come a time when you can&amp;rsquo;t use your device at all because the company has stopped providing services and it all goes straight to the junkyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I foresee the following situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legislate to avoid these situations. It has loopholes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you force a company outside the EU to provide service for the lifetime of a device?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to non-intelligent devices.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers will prefer to spend more money and have their device work regardless of whether the company goes bankrupt so they can fully enjoy their device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies dedicated to servicing these devices.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not usually economically viable/profitable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description></item><item><title>Social Networks and Society</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/social-networks-and-society.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social networks have been with us for more than &lt;strong&gt;two decades&lt;/strong&gt;. However, little education is being provided to our young people on how to use them responsibly. It is not just a &lt;em&gt;potential?&lt;/em&gt; problem for young people; the adult population will be faced with changing jobs, applying for a mortgage or a loan at a bank, or applying for a scholarship for their children&amp;hellip; all of these can be affected by the use of social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are not aware&lt;/strong&gt; of the amount of information we are sending, beyond a photo that may be innocent, to a social network that a priori should not share this information outside the platform, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="what-do-we-post-on-social-networks"&gt;
What do we post on social networks?
&lt;a href="#what-do-we-post-on-social-networks" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we post on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, we are not only posting the information we intend to share, but we are also giving away relevant information, such as: days you usually post photos, lifestyle habits/patterns, frequent locations, Are you currently working?&amp;hellip; even information about your personal, romantic or work relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no longer just the meme where you upload a photo and you&amp;rsquo;re at your friend&amp;rsquo;s house&amp;hellip; today your boss can see if you&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded a photo near a competitor&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an issue that does not have an easy solution because, at the end of the day, humans are social animals and as such, they seek acceptance by society. Sharing their experiences, their thoughts, their feelings on social networks seems to be the fastest way to achieve this acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id="black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality"&gt;
Black Mirror, dystopia or reality?
&lt;a href="#black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in &lt;a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror/seasons/3/episodes/1"&gt;Black mirror&lt;/a&gt;, the famous Netflix series, where one of the visions in which social networks take on a really dangerous protagonism was shown; it exposes a voting system where people rate your person and could leave you excluded from society if you do not receive enough positive votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you are not part of these social networks, you do not upload content or do not share your Christmas, vacation or travel photos&amp;hellip; it seems that you do nothing in your life. What about people who do not want to share, or do not know, or are not interested in sharing their life on social networks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could the day come when a humble, hardworking person, with demonstrable income, solvent, but who does not upload any type of content to any social network, is denied a loan for not having a minimum reputation in social networks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or even traveling&amp;hellip; at the borders. If the policeman/guard at the border cannot verify your person, since you have no presence on social networks&amp;hellip;. Would he let you enter the country? How will the absence of information be dealt with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information is power, everyone knows that, therefore, I can foresee certain socio/bureaucratic problems with people outside social networks that we will have to solve as a society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will they have to learn to share information about their life on social networks in order to travel? And if so&amp;hellip; Where will they get their information from? What will be their official source of information? If they were to make queries to platforms like Meta, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin and so on&amp;hellip;. How will they be able to verify that this data has not been altered by the companies themselves or if you have been hacked &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-many-users-facebook-losing"&gt;Who uses Facebook today?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; and they have posted content that is not legitimate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not a dystopia&lt;/strong&gt;, it is a reality that is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
