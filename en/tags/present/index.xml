&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s society, the use of mobile devices has become so common that even young children are increasingly exposed to them, posing a significant challenge for families.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As someone who works in the technology industry, it is frustrating to observe how our close-knit families are becoming increasingly absorbed by their mobile devices, without fully understanding the issues this can bring not only to themselves but also to those around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="denial">
Denial
&lt;a href="#denial" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What often goes unnoticed is that the content we consume on our screens is carefully designed to keep us hooked. From YouTube videos to Google search results, music on Spotify, and Netflix recommendations, &lt;strong>everything is designed to capture our attention&lt;/strong> and keep us engaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s most concerning is that, in many cases, &lt;strong>people do not recognize this problem&lt;/strong> or do not want to see it as such. Despite our attempts to explain and offer examples, they often find themselves in a &lt;strong>state of denial&lt;/strong>. The immediate reward they get from their screens seems to outweigh the need to reflect on the quality of what they are consuming.&lt;/p>

Family and the Future
&lt;a href="#family-and-the-future" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This dilemma also prompts us to think about the future and how we will educate the generations to come. In Silicon Valley, there is even a movement (&lt;em>Waldorf method&lt;/em>) among tech workers that restricts their children&amp;rsquo;s access to screens and mobile devices until a certain age, a practice that differs from what is commonly seen on the streets. While we work to create a tech-savvy world filled with recommendations and conveniences, we must also be aware of the dangers it poses and protect our children from them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s disheartening to see children as young as 2 or 3 years old walking with a phone in hand&lt;/strong>, watching cartoons on the screen. Even worse, what example are parents setting when they use TikTok, Instagram, or other social media platforms in front of their young children?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="psychology">
Psychology

&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Major tech companies employ massive teams of psychologists to design addictive interfaces for their applications. For example, Tinder&amp;rsquo;s interface is an example of exceptional design that allows you to find a partner in a matter of seconds. &lt;strong>Infinite scroll applications like Twitter and TikTok are also noteworthy for their ability to keep the brain absorbed in a constant stream of personalized information.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="conclusions">
Conclusions

&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In summary, social media addiction and mobile device dependence are significantly impacting families. As a society, we must address these issues, and at the same time, the technology industry must take responsibility to ensure that their products are not addictive. The future of our families and the balance in our relationship with technology depend on it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
