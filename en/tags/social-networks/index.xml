&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s society, the use of mobile devices has become so common that even young children are increasingly exposed to them, posing a significant challenge for families.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As someone who works in the technology industry, it is frustrating to observe how our close-knit families are becoming increasingly absorbed by their mobile devices, without fully understanding the issues this can bring not only to themselves but also to those around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="denial">
Denial
&lt;a href="#denial" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What often goes unnoticed is that the content we consume on our screens is carefully designed to keep us hooked. From YouTube videos to Google search results, music on Spotify, and Netflix recommendations, &lt;strong>everything is designed to capture our attention&lt;/strong> and keep us engaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s most concerning is that, in many cases, &lt;strong>people do not recognize this problem&lt;/strong> or do not want to see it as such. Despite our attempts to explain and offer examples, they often find themselves in a &lt;strong>state of denial&lt;/strong>. The immediate reward they get from their screens seems to outweigh the need to reflect on the quality of what they are consuming.&lt;/p>

Family and the Future
&lt;a href="#family-and-the-future" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This dilemma also prompts us to think about the future and how we will educate the generations to come. In Silicon Valley, there is even a movement (&lt;em>Waldorf method&lt;/em>) among tech workers that restricts their children&amp;rsquo;s access to screens and mobile devices until a certain age, a practice that differs from what is commonly seen on the streets. While we work to create a tech-savvy world filled with recommendations and conveniences, we must also be aware of the dangers it poses and protect our children from them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s disheartening to see children as young as 2 or 3 years old walking with a phone in hand&lt;/strong>, watching cartoons on the screen. Even worse, what example are parents setting when they use TikTok, Instagram, or other social media platforms in front of their young children?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="psychology">
Psychology
&lt;a href="#psychology" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Major tech companies employ massive teams of psychologists to design addictive interfaces for their applications. For example, Tinder&amp;rsquo;s interface is an example of exceptional design that allows you to find a partner in a matter of seconds. &lt;strong>Infinite scroll applications like Twitter and TikTok are also noteworthy for their ability to keep the brain absorbed in a constant stream of personalized information.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="conclusions">

&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In summary, social media addiction and mobile device dependence are significantly impacting families. As a society, we must address these issues, and at the same time, the technology industry must take responsibility to ensure that their products are not addictive. The future of our families and the balance in our relationship with technology depend on it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social Networks and Society</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Social networks have been with us for more than &lt;strong>two decades&lt;/strong>. However, little education is being provided to our young people on how to use them responsibly. It is not just a &lt;em>potential?&lt;/em> problem for young people; the adult population will be faced with changing jobs, applying for a mortgage or a loan at a bank, or applying for a scholarship for their children&amp;hellip; all of these can be affected by the use of social networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We are not aware&lt;/strong> of the amount of information we are sending, beyond a photo that may be innocent, to a social network that a priori should not share this information outside the platform, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-do-we-post-on-social-networks">
What do we post on social networks?
&lt;a href="#what-do-we-post-on-social-networks" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>When we post on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, we are not only posting the information we intend to share, but we are also giving away relevant information, such as: days you usually post photos, lifestyle habits/patterns, frequent locations, Are you currently working?&amp;hellip; even information about your personal, romantic or work relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s no longer just the meme where you upload a photo and you&amp;rsquo;re at your friend&amp;rsquo;s house&amp;hellip; today your boss can see if you&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded a photo near a competitor&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is an issue that does not have an easy solution because, at the end of the day, humans are social animals and as such, they seek acceptance by society. Sharing their experiences, their thoughts, their feelings on social networks seems to be the fastest way to achieve this acceptance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality">
Black Mirror, dystopia or reality?
&lt;a href="#black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It was in &lt;a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror/seasons/3/episodes/1">Black mirror&lt;/a>, the famous Netflix series, where one of the visions in which social networks take on a really dangerous protagonism was shown; it exposes a voting system where people rate your person and could leave you excluded from society if you do not receive enough positive votes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, if you are not part of these social networks, you do not upload content or do not share your Christmas, vacation or travel photos&amp;hellip; it seems that you do nothing in your life. What about people who do not want to share, or do not know, or are not interested in sharing their life on social networks?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Could the day come when a humble, hardworking person, with demonstrable income, solvent, but who does not upload any type of content to any social network, is denied a loan for not having a minimum reputation in social networks?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or even traveling&amp;hellip; at the borders. If the policeman/guard at the border cannot verify your person, since you have no presence on social networks&amp;hellip;. Would he let you enter the country? How will the absence of information be dealt with?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Information is power, everyone knows that, therefore, I can foresee certain socio/bureaucratic problems with people outside social networks that we will have to solve as a society.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Will they have to learn to share information about their life on social networks in order to travel? And if so&amp;hellip; Where will they get their information from? What will be their official source of information? If they were to make queries to platforms like Meta, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin and so on&amp;hellip;. How will they be able to verify that this data has not been altered by the companies themselves or if you have been hacked &lt;em>(&lt;a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-many-users-facebook-losing">Who uses Facebook today?&lt;/a>)&lt;/em> and they have posted content that is not legitimate?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It is not a dystopia&lt;/strong>, it is a reality that is just around the corner.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
