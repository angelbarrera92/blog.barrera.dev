&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/hyper-personalization.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about this before: AI isn’t a future promise, it’s our current reality. In previous posts we explored how it’s landing in our day-to-day (see &lt;a href="https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/en/ai-already-among-us/"&gt;AI. Already Among Us&lt;/a&gt;), but today I want to take it one step further. We’re entering the age of hyper-personalized software, and this is going to blow up the rules of the game as we know them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="generic-software"&gt;
Generic software
&lt;a href="#generic-software" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, we’ve adapted to software. We’ve built entire businesses around massive, generic tools: Jira, SAP, Salesforce, Stripe, or Trello. They’re engineering wonders, yes, but they have an intrinsic problem: one size fits all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For them to work in your business, you have to adapt to them. And that doesn’t just create operational friction, it also carries a huge cost. These platforms maintain massive infrastructures to be useful to millions of users, and that cost —direct and indirect— ends up landing on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bespoke-consulting"&gt;
Bespoke consulting
&lt;a href="#bespoke-consulting" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where AI moves the pieces. Until now, bespoke software was a slow and expensive luxury. But AI allows mid-sized companies and boutique consultancies to build specific solutions at a speed that was unthinkable before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why fight with the configuration of a generic CRM if you can have one designed exactly for your workflow in a fraction of the time? Software will no longer be a concrete block you have to adapt to, but a glove that’s woven &lt;strong&gt;in real time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="developer-role"&gt;
Developer role
&lt;a href="#developer-role" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift brings a mutation in roles that, personally, makes me a bit uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, we’ve valued developers for their technical specialization: the React expert, the COBOL “guru” who fixes impossible bugs, the database architect. But that “technical problem” is starting to disappear. If AI can find and fix a COBOL bug faster and cheaper than any expert consultant, what is the human’s value in the equation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value is no longer in the how (the code), but in the what and the why. The developer of the near future will have to stop looking only at syntax and start looking at product, service, and business impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-bottleneck"&gt;
New bottleneck
&lt;a href="#new-bottleneck" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In classic structures, there were layers of middle management dedicated to defining what to build, while the technical layers executed. It worked because cycles were long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if execution (development) becomes almost instantaneous thanks to AI, the bottleneck is no longer writing code, but definition. I foresee a drastic reduction of those middle layers. Management work will be optimized —or absorbed— by AI itself, forcing those who remain to be far more strategic and faster at validating ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="customer-dilemma"&gt;
Customer dilemma
&lt;a href="#customer-dilemma" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we move one step further and reach the end customer, we find a paradox. If it’s now easier, faster, and cheaper to create software, the market will be flooded with hyper-personalized options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As customers, are we prepared to receive that many inputs? How will we decide between one product and another when technical differentiation is minimal and the supply is infinite? Business validation will be faster than ever, but capturing the customer’s attention will be the ultimate challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;
Conclusion
&lt;a href="#conclusion" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re moving from a world where software was a rigid tool to one where it’s something far more flexible and moldable. Code is losing its value as an “asset” and becoming a “commodity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question I’m asking today is: if your professional value was based on solving technical problems that AI already solves in seconds, &lt;strong&gt;what’s your next move?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI. Already Among Us</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/ai-already-among-us/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/ai-already-among-us/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/googledeepmind.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, AI is already part of our daily lives, either explicitly or implicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the obvious: &lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;. It has been a massive boom. It is surprising how much it has evolved over these last three years. But there comes a point where the least expected person pulls out their smartphone &lt;em&gt;(likely with AI included, whatever that means&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em&gt; and directly asks their trusted app, ChatGPT, instead of using Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am not an AI expert, I understand well how technology works. One cannot or should not blindly trust what a screen responds to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="internet"&gt;
Internet
&lt;a href="#internet" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, we understand that on the internet you can find a statement about a topic and its opposite: Is the Earth flat? Where does the knowledge for these AI &lt;em&gt;(LLMs, large language models)&lt;/em&gt; come from? From the internet. That is why we cannot firmly trust an AI &lt;em&gt;(at least not today)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why do people trust AI more than Google? And mind you&amp;hellip; I am not saying that Google provides reliable information: Google gives you what you are looking for and, of course, what it deems relevant within its framework &lt;em&gt;(advertisers paying to position their responses at the top of the results)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="personification"&gt;
Personification
&lt;a href="#personification" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without being a psychologist, an immediate response with a human-like tone and personalization makes these answers seem fully truthful. But what many people do not understand is that these language models are very good at &amp;ldquo;inventing,&amp;rdquo; not so much in reasoning &lt;em&gt;(for now)&lt;/em&gt;. Additionally, there is the possibility of having conversational AI where you no longer need to write anything, just keep a button pressed and speak. The Speech-to-Text or Text-to-Speech models have been around for years, thanks to Google and Amazon&amp;rsquo;s famous assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="ia-implicitas"&gt;
IA implicitas
&lt;a href="#ia-implicitas" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people realize that AI has been part of our lives for some time: recommendation systems &lt;em&gt;(the famous algorithm)&lt;/em&gt;, virtual conversational agents on websites to answer certain questions about products or services, autonomous social media profiles&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all this leads me to think about two new areas I might discuss in another post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Theory of the Death of the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Media 2.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of awareness is often an error, at least from an engineer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. It is usually said that ignorance is bliss, and if I ever felt tempted to disconnect from the world and flow with it, perhaps I am not capable due to my nature: as an engineer, my mind always wants to solve problems or answer doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="tools"&gt;
Tools
&lt;a href="#tools" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t say anything you aren&amp;rsquo;t already imagining: AI remains a tool. Tools that are used correctly can be incredibly powerful. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text review, not just orthographically but also syntax checking and even suggesting alternative approaches. Who reviewed this text?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instant translation, linked to the previous point. If you work in a language different from your native one, it might be easier to write your ideas in your native language and then ask AI to maintain the tone and style of language for adapting to another language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract analysis. We live in an era where we sign contracts without reading them. Yes, it sounds strange, but it is the truth. For example&amp;hellip; I opened an online account with a well-known bank, this second account being shared, and the other person wanted the contract printed. I decided to print it out, and there were over 200 pages. Who has time to read through those 200 pages of banking jargon in detail? No one. But&amp;hellip; AI is here to help: you can attach the PDF to an AI, which will read it in milliseconds/seconds, and you can ask if the account has any hidden fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="conclusions"&gt;
Conclusions
&lt;a href="#conclusions" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this said, I can see that AI is already among us. This means we need to get our act together and learn how to use it as a tool. Otherwise, those who learn faster and are more productive with it will eventually take away our jobs. Embrace AI, dedicate time to understand how it works and its advantages and limitations. AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just &amp;ldquo;rounding an object in a photo to delete it.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s much more and adds value to many businesses and areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, if AI is free, you are the product :).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
