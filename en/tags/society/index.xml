&lt;p>Yes, AI is already part of our daily lives, either explicitly or implicitly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the obvious: &lt;strong>ChatGPT&lt;/strong>. It has been a massive boom. It is surprising how much it has evolved over these last three years. But there comes a point where the least expected person pulls out their smartphone &lt;em>(likely with AI included, whatever that means&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em> and directly asks their trusted app, ChatGPT, instead of using Google.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I am not an AI expert, I understand well how technology works. One cannot or should not blindly trust what a screen responds to.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="internet">
Internet
&lt;a href="#internet" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In general, we understand that on the internet you can find a statement about a topic and its opposite: Is the Earth flat? Where does the knowledge for these AI &lt;em>(LLMs, large language models)&lt;/em> come from? From the internet. That is why we cannot firmly trust an AI &lt;em>(at least not today)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, why do people trust AI more than Google? And mind you&amp;hellip; I am not saying that Google provides reliable information: Google gives you what you are looking for and, of course, what it deems relevant within its framework &lt;em>(advertisers paying to position their responses at the top of the results)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="personification">
Personification
&lt;a href="#personification" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Without being a psychologist, an immediate response with a human-like tone and personalization makes these answers seem fully truthful. But what many people do not understand is that these language models are very good at &amp;ldquo;inventing,&amp;rdquo; not so much in reasoning &lt;em>(for now)&lt;/em>. Additionally, there is the possibility of having conversational AI where you no longer need to write anything, just keep a button pressed and speak. The Speech-to-Text or Text-to-Speech models have been around for years, thanks to Google and Amazon&amp;rsquo;s famous assistants.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="ia-implicitas">
IA implicitas
&lt;a href="#ia-implicitas" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Many people realize that AI has been part of our lives for some time: recommendation systems &lt;em>(the famous algorithm)&lt;/em>, virtual conversational agents on websites to answer certain questions about products or services, autonomous social media profiles&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And all this leads me to think about two new areas I might discuss in another post:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Theory of the Death of the Internet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Social Media 2.0&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Lack of awareness is often an error, at least from an engineer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. It is usually said that ignorance is bliss, and if I ever felt tempted to disconnect from the world and flow with it, perhaps I am not capable due to my nature: as an engineer, my mind always wants to solve problems or answer doubts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="tools">
Tools
&lt;a href="#tools" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t say anything you aren&amp;rsquo;t already imagining: AI remains a tool. Tools that are used correctly can be incredibly powerful. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Text review, not just orthographically but also syntax checking and even suggesting alternative approaches. Who reviewed this text?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Instant translation, linked to the previous point. If you work in a language different from your native one, it might be easier to write your ideas in your native language and then ask AI to maintain the tone and style of language for adapting to another language.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Contract analysis. We live in an era where we sign contracts without reading them. Yes, it sounds strange, but it is the truth. For example&amp;hellip; I opened an online account with a well-known bank, this second account being shared, and the other person wanted the contract printed. I decided to print it out, and there were over 200 pages. Who has time to read through those 200 pages of banking jargon in detail? No one. But&amp;hellip; AI is here to help: you can attach the PDF to an AI, which will read it in milliseconds/seconds, and you can ask if the account has any hidden fees.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="conclusions">
Conclusions
&lt;a href="#conclusions" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>All this said, I can see that AI is already among us. This means we need to get our act together and learn how to use it as a tool. Otherwise, those who learn faster and are more productive with it will eventually take away our jobs. Embrace AI, dedicate time to understand how it works and its advantages and limitations. AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just &amp;ldquo;rounding an object in a photo to delete it.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s much more and adds value to many businesses and areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And remember, if AI is free, you are the product :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social Media Addictions</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/addictions-to-social-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/addictions-to-social-networks/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/addictions-to-social-networks.jpg"/>
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s society, the use of mobile devices has become so common that even young children are increasingly exposed to them, posing a significant challenge for families.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As someone who works in the technology industry, it is frustrating to observe how our close-knit families are becoming increasingly absorbed by their mobile devices, without fully understanding the issues this can bring not only to themselves but also to those around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="denial">
Denial
&lt;a href="#denial" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>What often goes unnoticed is that the content we consume on our screens is carefully designed to keep us hooked. From YouTube videos to Google search results, music on Spotify, and Netflix recommendations, &lt;strong>everything is designed to capture our attention&lt;/strong> and keep us engaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s most concerning is that, in many cases, &lt;strong>people do not recognize this problem&lt;/strong> or do not want to see it as such. Despite our attempts to explain and offer examples, they often find themselves in a &lt;strong>state of denial&lt;/strong>. The immediate reward they get from their screens seems to outweigh the need to reflect on the quality of what they are consuming.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="family-and-the-future">
Family and the Future
&lt;a href="#family-and-the-future" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This dilemma also prompts us to think about the future and how we will educate the generations to come. In Silicon Valley, there is even a movement (&lt;em>Waldorf method&lt;/em>) among tech workers that restricts their children&amp;rsquo;s access to screens and mobile devices until a certain age, a practice that differs from what is commonly seen on the streets. While we work to create a tech-savvy world filled with recommendations and conveniences, we must also be aware of the dangers it poses and protect our children from them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s disheartening to see children as young as 2 or 3 years old walking with a phone in hand&lt;/strong>, watching cartoons on the screen. Even worse, what example are parents setting when they use TikTok, Instagram, or other social media platforms in front of their young children?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="psychology">
Psychology
&lt;a href="#psychology" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Major tech companies employ massive teams of psychologists to design addictive interfaces for their applications. For example, Tinder&amp;rsquo;s interface is an example of exceptional design that allows you to find a partner in a matter of seconds. &lt;strong>Infinite scroll applications like Twitter and TikTok are also noteworthy for their ability to keep the brain absorbed in a constant stream of personalized information.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="conclusions">
Conclusions
&lt;a href="#conclusions" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>In summary, social media addiction and mobile device dependence are significantly impacting families. As a society, we must address these issues, and at the same time, the technology industry must take responsibility to ensure that their products are not addictive. The future of our families and the balance in our relationship with technology depend on it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social Networks and Society</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/social-networks-and-society.jpg"/>
&lt;p>Social networks have been with us for more than &lt;strong>two decades&lt;/strong>. However, little education is being provided to our young people on how to use them responsibly. It is not just a &lt;em>potential?&lt;/em> problem for young people; the adult population will be faced with changing jobs, applying for a mortgage or a loan at a bank, or applying for a scholarship for their children&amp;hellip; all of these can be affected by the use of social networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We are not aware&lt;/strong> of the amount of information we are sending, beyond a photo that may be innocent, to a social network that a priori should not share this information outside the platform, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-do-we-post-on-social-networks">
What do we post on social networks?
&lt;a href="#what-do-we-post-on-social-networks" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>When we post on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, we are not only posting the information we intend to share, but we are also giving away relevant information, such as: days you usually post photos, lifestyle habits/patterns, frequent locations, Are you currently working?&amp;hellip; even information about your personal, romantic or work relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s no longer just the meme where you upload a photo and you&amp;rsquo;re at your friend&amp;rsquo;s house&amp;hellip; today your boss can see if you&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded a photo near a competitor&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is an issue that does not have an easy solution because, at the end of the day, humans are social animals and as such, they seek acceptance by society. Sharing their experiences, their thoughts, their feelings on social networks seems to be the fastest way to achieve this acceptance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality">
Black Mirror, dystopia or reality?
&lt;a href="#black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It was in &lt;a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror/seasons/3/episodes/1">Black mirror&lt;/a>, the famous Netflix series, where one of the visions in which social networks take on a really dangerous protagonism was shown; it exposes a voting system where people rate your person and could leave you excluded from society if you do not receive enough positive votes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, if you are not part of these social networks, you do not upload content or do not share your Christmas, vacation or travel photos&amp;hellip; it seems that you do nothing in your life. What about people who do not want to share, or do not know, or are not interested in sharing their life on social networks?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Could the day come when a humble, hardworking person, with demonstrable income, solvent, but who does not upload any type of content to any social network, is denied a loan for not having a minimum reputation in social networks?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or even traveling&amp;hellip; at the borders. If the policeman/guard at the border cannot verify your person, since you have no presence on social networks&amp;hellip;. Would he let you enter the country? How will the absence of information be dealt with?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Information is power, everyone knows that, therefore, I can foresee certain socio/bureaucratic problems with people outside social networks that we will have to solve as a society.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Will they have to learn to share information about their life on social networks in order to travel? And if so&amp;hellip; Where will they get their information from? What will be their official source of information? If they were to make queries to platforms like Meta, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin and so on&amp;hellip;. How will they be able to verify that this data has not been altered by the companies themselves or if you have been hacked &lt;em>(&lt;a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-many-users-facebook-losing">Who uses Facebook today?&lt;/a>)&lt;/em> and they have posted content that is not legitimate?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It is not a dystopia&lt;/strong>, it is a reality that is just around the corner.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
