&lt;p>The use of electric vehicles &lt;em>(EVs)&lt;/em> is increasing in popularity around the world, and Spain is no exception. As more and more people turn to EVs to reduce their carbon footprint and save on fuel costs, it is important to understand the challenges and opportunities that come with using these vehicles in urban environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="challenges">
Challenges
&lt;a href="#challenges" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>One of the main challenges of using EVs in cities is the lack of charging infrastructure. While more and more charging stations are being installed, it can still be difficult to find a place to recharge your vehicle when you&amp;rsquo;re on the go. This can be especially true in areas with high demand, such as central business districts and tourist areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another challenge is the so-called &amp;ldquo;range anxiety&amp;rdquo; - the fear that your EV will run out of charge before you reach your destination. While this fear is generally unfounded, as most EVs can easily cover the average daily driving distance of around 50 km, it can still be a concern for some drivers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way to overcome these challenges is to use public charging apps, which can help you locate nearby charging stations and plan your route accordingly. However, the proliferation of these apps can make it difficult to choose the right one, and some of them may not be reliable or user-friendly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="then">
Then?
&lt;a href="#then" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Despite these challenges, there are many good reasons to consider using an EV in a Spanish city. For one, EVs are generally more efficient and cost-effective than gasoline-powered vehicles, especially in urban environments where stop-and-go traffic is common. In addition, EVs produce zero emissions, which helps reduce air pollution and improve public health.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another benefit of EVs is that they can be charged at home, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to rely on public charging stations. This is especially convenient for people who live in apartments or other dwellings without access to off-street parking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, while there are challenges to using EVs in Spanish cities, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. With the right charging infrastructure and a little planning, EVs can be a great option for urban residents looking to reduce their environmental impact and save on fuel costs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IOT - Intelligent Devices</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/iot-intelligent-devices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/iot-intelligent-devices/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/iot-intelligent-devices.jpg"/>
&lt;p>I recently discovered that my vacuum robot stopped working for more than three days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could not configure the vacuuming program, that is, I could not modify the cleaning plan to define the rooms to be cleaned nor modify the suction power that the application allows you to set &lt;strong>and you cannot do it in any other way&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="then">
Then?
&lt;a href="#then" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Actually, you can turn the robot on with the button on the device itself and it will perform the last run it was configured to do. Hopefully it will be the entire house at sufficient suction power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few days, the app started working again&amp;hellip; but this gave me pause. We rely on third-party services when we buy certain products, such as robot vacuums, smart plugs, surveillance cameras, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this situation there are &lt;em>(mainly)&lt;/em> two groups of people:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Common people&lt;/strong> who do not have to know these details and buy this kind of devices because they like or need them.
They think they can be a good solution for them, but in this kind of situations, the only thing they can do is to call the store where they bought it or call the manufacturer to manage the warranty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Computer scientists&lt;/strong> or those of us who like to solve technological problems and understand how this type of devices work, i.e. we know that they connect to a remote server to send/receive data &lt;em>(which we don&amp;rsquo;t usually like)&lt;/em> and that we need to interact with them from inside and outside the home through an application.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="surveillance-cameras">
Surveillance cameras
&lt;a href="#surveillance-cameras" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>These also apply to surveillance cameras. The common use of a surveillance camera is to be able to see what is happening in the house in real time from anywhere. In addition, upon any event/movement to receive security notifications. For this we rely, implicitly, on external services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are users aware of how this works? If they knew that the images pass through a server of a company &lt;em>(which may or may not be the manufacturer of the product)&lt;/em>, the content is analyzed and stored in the cloud, would they buy it? Would they use it? Would they install it at home?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The general public does not have to know this detail, for most it is just an application which configures the surveillance camera and magically you can see what happens in your home from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But &lt;strong>magic does not exist&lt;/strong>, on this we all agree.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="alternatives">
Alternatives
&lt;a href="#alternatives" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I found a group of affected &lt;em>(on telegram)&lt;/em> and it turns out I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one&amp;hellip;. The reason was that the servers of this brand went down and was out of service during that weekend completely.
In this telegram group I discovered that there was a way by which to set up a compatible server on my own. This way, I would be the only one responsible for keeping the service running so I could use my robot vacuum cleaner and be able to configure it without having to depend on that third party company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After several hours of reading information and after studying &lt;em>(not trivial)&lt;/em> how to access and re-configure &lt;em>(root)&lt;/em> the robot to use this new method, I finally got it working.
All this is only feasible if you are a computer scientist and like this kind of stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="future">
Future
&lt;a href="#future" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For the general public I foresee legal problems with warranties, ie:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What if your robot vacuum cleaner stops working?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if it stops giving you certain functionality if a company&amp;rsquo;s server stops working?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if the company goes bankrupt?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>o&amp;hellip; any other reason that makes you unable to use that application to configure your device?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Is there some kind of law that mandates that you have to support and provide services for at least the life of the device?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If not&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>What responsibility does the company have to maintain the server or that service beyond a year or two years from the sale of the product?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, we could get to a point where your device is a paperweight, right? &lt;strong>Even if it&amp;rsquo;s in good shape&lt;/strong>.
There may come a time when you can&amp;rsquo;t use your device at all because the company has stopped providing services and it all goes straight to the junkyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I foresee the following situations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Legislate to avoid these situations. It has loopholes:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How can you force a company outside the EU to provide service for the lifetime of a device?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Return to non-intelligent devices.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Consumers will prefer to spend more money and have their device work regardless of whether the company goes bankrupt so they can fully enjoy their device.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies dedicated to servicing these devices.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Not usually economically viable/profitable&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Layoffs at Meta</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/meta-layoffs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/meta-layoffs/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/meta-layoffs.jpg"/>
&lt;p>Today has been known as one of the &lt;a href="(https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/)">biggest layoffs in the history of technology&lt;/a>; in this case, the lucky one, to call it somehow, has been &lt;a href="https://about.meta.com/es/meta/">meta&lt;/a>, commonly known as &lt;strong>Facebook&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is really hard news, it is more than eleven thousand employees, or what is the same, almost &lt;strong>eleven thousand families&lt;/strong> around the world. In recent weeks, we have seen other layoffs at Stripe, Uber, Twitter&amp;hellip; &lt;a href="https://layoffs.fyi/">source&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reasons for these layoffs are motivated by the &lt;em>post-pandemic?&lt;/em> era. Let&amp;rsquo;s remember that during the pandemic, these services &lt;em>(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Twitch&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em> gained a lot of customers and relevance as they were one of the few entertainments we had during the confinements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, we are facing what is possibly the third world war &lt;em>(initiated by Russia&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em>, a semiconductor crisis, an oligopoly in microchip manufacturing &lt;em>(led by TSMC)&lt;/em>, climate change, and extremist politics &lt;em>(Italy)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of us who work, in one way or another, in the technology world wonder if we are safe from these layoffs. We also wonder if it is particular to large technology companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Is there an oversizing of employees in these technology companies?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Since this is my first post I would like to clarify that everything here is just personal opinions; I am not a researcher or a journalist at all. I simply give the vision of a *(non-)*engineer working in this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="does-this-mean-or-mean-that-a-technological-bubble-that-many-believe-exists-has-burst">
Does this mean or mean that a technological bubble that many believe exists has burst?
&lt;a href="#does-this-mean-or-mean-that-a-technological-bubble-that-many-believe-exists-has-burst" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I would say &lt;strong>no&lt;/strong>. If you look around you, absolutely everything is based on technology; from your washing machine, your phone, your TV, your smart speaker&amp;hellip; everything has a microprocessor with software that has to be maintained; both the embedded software and the services behind it. So I don&amp;rsquo;t think we are in a technological bubble, but rather a very complex global contingency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can only wait to see which will be the next company to have &amp;ldquo;massive&amp;rdquo; layoffs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
