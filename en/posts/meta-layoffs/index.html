In recent weeks, we have seen other layoffs at Stripe, Uber, Twitter&mldr; <a href=https://layoffs.fyi/>source</a>.</p><p>The reasons for these layoffs are motivated by the <em>post-pandemic?</em> era. Let&rsquo;s remember that during the pandemic, these services <em>(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Twitch&mldr;)</em> gained a lot of customers and relevance as they were one of the few entertainments we had during the confinements.</p><p>In addition, we are facing what is possibly the third world war <em>(initiated by Russia&mldr;)</em>, a semiconductor crisis, an oligopoly in microchip manufacturing <em>(led by TSMC)</em>, climate change, and extremist politics <em>(Italy)</em>.</p><p>All of us who work, in one way or another, in the technology world wonder if we are safe from these layoffs. We also wonder if it is particular to large technology companies.</p><p><em>Is there an oversizing of employees in these technology companies?</em></p><blockquote><p>Since this is my first post I would like to clarify that everything here is just personal opinions; I am not a researcher or a journalist at all. I simply give the vision of a *(non-)*engineer working in this world.</p></blockquote><h4 id=does-this-mean-or-mean-that-a-technological-bubble-that-many-believe-exists-has-burst>Does this mean or mean that a technological bubble that many believe exists has burst?
<a href=#does-this-mean-or-mean-that-a-technological-bubble-that-many-believe-exists-has-burst class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><p>I would say <strong>no</strong>. If you look around you, absolutely everything is based on technology; from your washing machine, your phone, your TV, your smart speaker&mldr; everything has a microprocessor with software that has to be maintained; both the embedded software and the services behind it. So I don&rsquo;t think we are in a technological bubble, but rather a very complex global contingency.</p><p>We can only wait to see which will be the next company to have &ldquo;massive&rdquo; layoffs.</p></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user">¬© 2022, √Ångel Barrera</div></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/bundle.min.js></script></div></body></html>
