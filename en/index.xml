&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/hyper-personalization.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about this before: AI isn’t a future promise, it’s our current reality. In previous posts we explored how it’s landing in our day-to-day (see &lt;a href="https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/en/ai-already-among-us/"&gt;AI. Already Among Us&lt;/a&gt;), but today I want to take it one step further. We’re entering the age of hyper-personalized software, and this is going to blow up the rules of the game as we know them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="generic-software"&gt;
Generic software
&lt;a href="#generic-software" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, we’ve adapted to software. We’ve built entire businesses around massive, generic tools: Jira, SAP, Salesforce, Stripe, or Trello. They’re engineering wonders, yes, but they have an intrinsic problem: one size fits all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For them to work in your business, you have to adapt to them. And that doesn’t just create operational friction, it also carries a huge cost. These platforms maintain massive infrastructures to be useful to millions of users, and that cost —direct and indirect— ends up landing on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bespoke-consulting"&gt;
Bespoke consulting
&lt;a href="#bespoke-consulting" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where AI moves the pieces. Until now, bespoke software was a slow and expensive luxury. But AI allows mid-sized companies and boutique consultancies to build specific solutions at a speed that was unthinkable before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why fight with the configuration of a generic CRM if you can have one designed exactly for your workflow in a fraction of the time? Software will no longer be a concrete block you have to adapt to, but a glove that’s woven &lt;strong&gt;in real time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="developer-role"&gt;
Developer role
&lt;a href="#developer-role" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift brings a mutation in roles that, personally, makes me a bit uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, we’ve valued developers for their technical specialization: the React expert, the COBOL “guru” who fixes impossible bugs, the database architect. But that “technical problem” is starting to disappear. If AI can find and fix a COBOL bug faster and cheaper than any expert consultant, what is the human’s value in the equation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value is no longer in the how (the code), but in the what and the why. The developer of the near future will have to stop looking only at syntax and start looking at product, service, and business impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-bottleneck"&gt;
New bottleneck
&lt;a href="#new-bottleneck" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In classic structures, there were layers of middle management dedicated to defining what to build, while the technical layers executed. It worked because cycles were long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if execution (development) becomes almost instantaneous thanks to AI, the bottleneck is no longer writing code, but definition. I foresee a drastic reduction of those middle layers. Management work will be optimized —or absorbed— by AI itself, forcing those who remain to be far more strategic and faster at validating ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="customer-dilemma"&gt;
Customer dilemma
&lt;a href="#customer-dilemma" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we move one step further and reach the end customer, we find a paradox. If it’s now easier, faster, and cheaper to create software, the market will be flooded with hyper-personalized options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As customers, are we prepared to receive that many inputs? How will we decide between one product and another when technical differentiation is minimal and the supply is infinite? Business validation will be faster than ever, but capturing the customer’s attention will be the ultimate challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;
Conclusion
&lt;a href="#conclusion" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re moving from a world where software was a rigid tool to one where it’s something far more flexible and moldable. Code is losing its value as an “asset” and becoming a “commodity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question I’m asking today is: if your professional value was based on solving technical problems that AI already solves in seconds, &lt;strong&gt;what’s your next move?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI. Already Among Us</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/ai-already-among-us/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/ai-already-among-us/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/googledeepmind.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, AI is already part of our daily lives, either explicitly or implicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the obvious: &lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;. It has been a massive boom. It is surprising how much it has evolved over these last three years. But there comes a point where the least expected person pulls out their smartphone &lt;em&gt;(likely with AI included, whatever that means&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em&gt; and directly asks their trusted app, ChatGPT, instead of using Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am not an AI expert, I understand well how technology works. One cannot or should not blindly trust what a screen responds to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="internet"&gt;
Internet
&lt;a href="#internet" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, we understand that on the internet you can find a statement about a topic and its opposite: Is the Earth flat? Where does the knowledge for these AI &lt;em&gt;(LLMs, large language models)&lt;/em&gt; come from? From the internet. That is why we cannot firmly trust an AI &lt;em&gt;(at least not today)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why do people trust AI more than Google? And mind you&amp;hellip; I am not saying that Google provides reliable information: Google gives you what you are looking for and, of course, what it deems relevant within its framework &lt;em&gt;(advertisers paying to position their responses at the top of the results)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="personification"&gt;
Personification
&lt;a href="#personification" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without being a psychologist, an immediate response with a human-like tone and personalization makes these answers seem fully truthful. But what many people do not understand is that these language models are very good at &amp;ldquo;inventing,&amp;rdquo; not so much in reasoning &lt;em&gt;(for now)&lt;/em&gt;. Additionally, there is the possibility of having conversational AI where you no longer need to write anything, just keep a button pressed and speak. The Speech-to-Text or Text-to-Speech models have been around for years, thanks to Google and Amazon&amp;rsquo;s famous assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="ia-implicitas"&gt;
IA implicitas
&lt;a href="#ia-implicitas" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people realize that AI has been part of our lives for some time: recommendation systems &lt;em&gt;(the famous algorithm)&lt;/em&gt;, virtual conversational agents on websites to answer certain questions about products or services, autonomous social media profiles&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all this leads me to think about two new areas I might discuss in another post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Theory of the Death of the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Media 2.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of awareness is often an error, at least from an engineer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. It is usually said that ignorance is bliss, and if I ever felt tempted to disconnect from the world and flow with it, perhaps I am not capable due to my nature: as an engineer, my mind always wants to solve problems or answer doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="tools"&gt;
Tools
&lt;a href="#tools" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t say anything you aren&amp;rsquo;t already imagining: AI remains a tool. Tools that are used correctly can be incredibly powerful. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text review, not just orthographically but also syntax checking and even suggesting alternative approaches. Who reviewed this text?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instant translation, linked to the previous point. If you work in a language different from your native one, it might be easier to write your ideas in your native language and then ask AI to maintain the tone and style of language for adapting to another language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract analysis. We live in an era where we sign contracts without reading them. Yes, it sounds strange, but it is the truth. For example&amp;hellip; I opened an online account with a well-known bank, this second account being shared, and the other person wanted the contract printed. I decided to print it out, and there were over 200 pages. Who has time to read through those 200 pages of banking jargon in detail? No one. But&amp;hellip; AI is here to help: you can attach the PDF to an AI, which will read it in milliseconds/seconds, and you can ask if the account has any hidden fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="conclusions"&gt;
Conclusions
&lt;a href="#conclusions" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this said, I can see that AI is already among us. This means we need to get our act together and learn how to use it as a tool. Otherwise, those who learn faster and are more productive with it will eventually take away our jobs. Embrace AI, dedicate time to understand how it works and its advantages and limitations. AI isn&amp;rsquo;t just &amp;ldquo;rounding an object in a photo to delete it.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s much more and adds value to many businesses and areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember, if AI is free, you are the product :).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The consequences of not teaching children about delayed gratification</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/consequences-not-teaching-about-delayed-gratification/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/consequences-not-teaching-about-delayed-gratification/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/patient.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we navigate our increasingly complex and fast-paced world, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the instant gratification culture that surrounds us. With just a few clicks on our smartphones, we can access anything from entertainment to education. But what about our children? Are they being taught the importance of delayed gratification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many parents are not teaching their kids &lt;strong&gt;about the value of saving and waiting for things they want&lt;/strong&gt;. This lack of financial literacy can have far-reaching consequences, leading to a society that values immediate pleasure over long-term planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="buy-now-consume-later"&gt;
Buy now, consume later
&lt;a href="#buy-now-consume-later" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, it&amp;rsquo;s more important than ever to teach children about delayed gratification. With the rise of subscription-based services and pay-per-use models, &lt;strong&gt;our kids are constantly bombarded with offers to buy now and consume later&lt;/strong&gt;. This can lead to a culture of instant consumption, where the value of saving and planning for the future is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of not teaching children about delayed gratification are far-reaching. When kids learn that they can have anything they want instantly, they may become entitled or develop &lt;strong&gt;unrealistic expectations&lt;/strong&gt;. This can lead to problems with self-control, decision-making, and financial responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="finances"&gt;
Finances
&lt;a href="#finances" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the lack of financial literacy among children can have &lt;strong&gt;serious long-term effects on their economic well-being&lt;/strong&gt;. Studies have shown that individuals who are not financially literate are more likely to struggle with debt, savings, and retirement planning. These issues can have a significant impact on their overall quality of life and ability to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="what-can-we-do"&gt;
What can we do?
&lt;a href="#what-can-we-do" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what can parents do to teach children about delayed gratification? Here are some practical tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set clear expectations&lt;/strong&gt;: Establish clear rules and consequences for your child&amp;rsquo;s behavior, including the importance of saving and waiting for things they want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model good behavior&lt;/strong&gt;: Show your child that you also value delayed gratification &lt;strong&gt;by practicing&lt;/strong&gt; what you preach. Demonstrate the benefits of saving and planning for the future by setting goals and achieving them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage goal-setting&lt;/strong&gt;: Help your child set short-term and long-term goals, and encourage them to work towards achieving those goals through savings and planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach the value of money&lt;/strong&gt;: Educate your child about the value of money and the importance of earning it. Encourage them to seek out opportunities for financial gain and teach them how to manage their earnings wisely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage patience and self-control&lt;/strong&gt;: Teach your child the importance of waiting and delaying gratification in order to achieve long-term goals. Encourage them to practice self-control and make smart decisions about spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="final-words"&gt;
Final words
&lt;a href="#final-words" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By teaching children about delayed gratification, we can help them develop &lt;em&gt;essential life skills&lt;/em&gt; that will serve them well into adulthood. By modeling good behavior, setting clear expectations, encouraging goal-setting, teaching the value of money, and encouraging patience and self-control, we can raise a generation of financially responsible individuals who are better equipped to navigate the challenges of the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Social Media Addictions</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/addictions-to-social-networks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/addictions-to-social-networks/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/addictions-to-social-networks.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s society, the use of mobile devices has become so common that even young children are increasingly exposed to them, posing a significant challenge for families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who works in the technology industry, it is frustrating to observe how our close-knit families are becoming increasingly absorbed by their mobile devices, without fully understanding the issues this can bring not only to themselves but also to those around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="denial"&gt;
Denial
&lt;a href="#denial" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What often goes unnoticed is that the content we consume on our screens is carefully designed to keep us hooked. From YouTube videos to Google search results, music on Spotify, and Netflix recommendations, &lt;strong&gt;everything is designed to capture our attention&lt;/strong&gt; and keep us engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s most concerning is that, in many cases, &lt;strong&gt;people do not recognize this problem&lt;/strong&gt; or do not want to see it as such. Despite our attempts to explain and offer examples, they often find themselves in a &lt;strong&gt;state of denial&lt;/strong&gt;. The immediate reward they get from their screens seems to outweigh the need to reflect on the quality of what they are consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="family-and-the-future"&gt;
Family and the Future
&lt;a href="#family-and-the-future" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dilemma also prompts us to think about the future and how we will educate the generations to come. In Silicon Valley, there is even a movement (&lt;em&gt;Waldorf method&lt;/em&gt;) among tech workers that restricts their children&amp;rsquo;s access to screens and mobile devices until a certain age, a practice that differs from what is commonly seen on the streets. While we work to create a tech-savvy world filled with recommendations and conveniences, we must also be aware of the dangers it poses and protect our children from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s disheartening to see children as young as 2 or 3 years old walking with a phone in hand&lt;/strong&gt;, watching cartoons on the screen. Even worse, what example are parents setting when they use TikTok, Instagram, or other social media platforms in front of their young children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="psychology"&gt;
Psychology
&lt;a href="#psychology" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major tech companies employ massive teams of psychologists to design addictive interfaces for their applications. For example, Tinder&amp;rsquo;s interface is an example of exceptional design that allows you to find a partner in a matter of seconds. &lt;strong&gt;Infinite scroll applications like Twitter and TikTok are also noteworthy for their ability to keep the brain absorbed in a constant stream of personalized information.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="conclusions"&gt;
Conclusions
&lt;a href="#conclusions" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, social media addiction and mobile device dependence are significantly impacting families. As a society, we must address these issues, and at the same time, the technology industry must take responsibility to ensure that their products are not addictive. The future of our families and the balance in our relationship with technology depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IDP in the enterprise</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/idp-in-the-enterprise/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/idp-in-the-enterprise/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/idp-in-the-enterprise.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I spent some time understanding how an IDP could be implemented in the enterprise. I found a few articles and videos that were helpful, but I was still left with a few questions. In particular, I wanted to know &lt;strong&gt;how IDP should be implemented in a siloed and political environment&lt;/strong&gt;. I also wanted to know how to deal with the inevitable resistance to change that would come from the different departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDP stands for &lt;strong&gt;Internal Development Platform&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/angelbarrera92/idp-enterprise-research/blob/main/outcome.md"&gt;Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find the optimistic approach how to implement an IDP&lt;/a&gt;, unfortunately, it assumes that the organization is well structured and that &lt;strong&gt;the people are willing to change&lt;/strong&gt;, including the middle management, directors and, development teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, unfortunately, is not the case in most organizations. The reality is that &lt;strong&gt;most organizations are siloed and political&lt;/strong&gt;, and the people are not willing to change, even worse in economical crisis times. This is why I decided to write this article, to share my point of view after talking with a few people in the industry in the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="the-situation"&gt;
The situation
&lt;a href="#the-situation" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost &lt;em&gt;2023&lt;/em&gt;, and every industry is digitalized, from retail to banks, commerces, and governs so it&amp;rsquo;s a fact that &lt;strong&gt;we need engineers to run a modern society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these enterprises &lt;em&gt;succeed&lt;/em&gt; in adopting the cloud. Some of them are &lt;a href="https://www.channelpronetwork.com/article/return-prem"&gt;returning to on-prem&lt;/a&gt;, but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic I would like to discuss in another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprises moved from &lt;em&gt;on-premises&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;cloud&lt;/em&gt;. Some of them tried to follow the same procedures and processes as they were following before in their data centers. That didn&amp;rsquo;t work, engineers were struggling to develop and implement projects they were hiring for, resulting in managers and middle management didn&amp;rsquo;t see any improvement by moving to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, they had two options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating as they were doing assuming the cloud is not going to provide them any higher benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the way of working adopting the flexibility of the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those companies that adopted the second point, had to replace certain roles and processes in the company.
This could lead to significant changes in the company&amp;rsquo;s management structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is managing access to the cloud?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is taking care of the cloud accounts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the employees use any service in the cloud?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is responsible for managing the firewall on cloud instances?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the billing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, this caused a lot of difficulties for companies. These changes are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; affecting a few IT departments which adopt automation processes and provide services to the developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="developers"&gt;
Developers
&lt;a href="#developers" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers, &lt;em&gt;back in the day&lt;/em&gt;, focus on developing business requirements. Then, they push the code somewhere else, &lt;strong&gt;the job is done&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all agree &lt;strong&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s not enough&lt;/strong&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;strong&gt;there is no consensus about what is enough&lt;/strong&gt; for a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should a developer take care of a pipeline?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the developer aware of the steps the pipeline should run?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should the developer be aware of the security of the &lt;em&gt;pipeline/code/infrastructure/data&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers want to focus on writing code and delivering business value&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than worrying about infrastructure and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost 2023, &lt;em&gt;in the cloud&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;containers&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;APIs&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;vulnerabilities&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;contractors&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;internal development teams&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;CNCF&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="cncf"&gt;
CNCF
&lt;a href="#cncf" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Native Computing Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;. This brought us a lot of tools and a lot of confusion. I mean, &lt;em&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;linkerd&lt;/em&gt;, and other projects are &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt;. Unfortunately, every project hosted in the CNCF is a piece of software that does nothing alone. So, &lt;strong&gt;you need to understand how to use them, and you need to know how to integrate them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not easy, &lt;strong&gt;is this something the developer should take care of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CNCF is the main reason why companies are investing today in platform teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="consequences"&gt;
Consequences
&lt;a href="#consequences" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onboarding is a pain in the ass, both for the employee and the employer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employee has to understand a lot of different technologies and how these have been implemented in the company/project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employer, trying to find a good engineer in the current market is a chimera. You would need to pay them a lot as you require from the engineer a lot of knowledge. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget we are right now in an economical crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the offboarding. &lt;strong&gt;Engineers want to engineer right&lt;/strong&gt;? So if they find better opportunities inside the same company or outside it, an engineer will pursue these opportunities, so you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with unfinished projects/products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, remove permissions for that particular engineer, and &lt;strong&gt;try to onboard a new employee&lt;/strong&gt; in the project/product these days&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="micro-platforms"&gt;
micro platforms
&lt;a href="#micro-platforms" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find &lt;strong&gt;micro-platforms&lt;/strong&gt; on different teams. &lt;em&gt;What is this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are frameworks advanced developers in the team develop to &lt;strong&gt;standardize the way their team works&lt;/strong&gt;, they are already realizing that there is a standardization problem in the company they are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the inevitable problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;em&gt;(use to)&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t have enough context to properly implement the &lt;em&gt;(micro)&lt;/em&gt; platform, and they probably could be tied to certain services the company could be giving &lt;em&gt;(ticketing system, alerting, runtime, metrics&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em&gt; and it will cause a lot of friction with the IT teams &lt;em&gt;(infra, platform, cloud, security&amp;hellip;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds clear to me; teams are developing their way of developing. &lt;strong&gt;Then it means that there is a potential requirement in the company&lt;/strong&gt;, and this is standardizing the way of developing &lt;em&gt;(IDP)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="the-ugly-truth"&gt;
The ugly truth
&lt;a href="#the-ugly-truth" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason why there is no single internal development platform is not about tech, there are a humongous number of technologies ready to glue together to cover most of the use cases you can see in your company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, what&amp;rsquo;s the issue?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Middle management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a traditional enterprise, you will see a well-defined organizational structure with multiple layers of management. From the C level to the bottom you can find 3-4-5 levels of management &lt;em&gt;(even more; the larger the company is, the more levels you&amp;rsquo;ll find)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every manager cares about X employees and/or managers.
&lt;strong&gt;The more reports the manager receives, the &amp;ldquo;more important&amp;rdquo; the manager is for the company&lt;/strong&gt;, at least, this is what we can see in these kinds of large companies. Also, they are used to working in a project approach, providing services for different areas. So you should expect to interact within areas through tickets/forms&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then&amp;hellip; What would happen if someone tries to implement an IDP that involves many different departments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/IDPCapabilities.png" alt="IDP Capabilities" class="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle management could take this &lt;em&gt;(and they do)&lt;/em&gt; as an attack on their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="conclusion"&gt;
Conclusion
&lt;a href="#conclusion" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a silver bullet, but I have a few ideas that could help you to start thinking about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a look at your environment&lt;/strong&gt;; Is your manager aware of the current situation? If not, try to explain the situation to your manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with the developers&lt;/strong&gt;. Developers are the ones who are going to use the platform, so they should be the ones who are going to define the requirements and the capabilities of the platform. &lt;strong&gt;Treat them as your customers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start small&lt;/strong&gt;. Start with a small team, and try to implement a micro-platform that can be used by a few teams. Then, try to expand the platform to other teams by presenting the benefits of using this platform to your manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with the basics&lt;/strong&gt;. Start with the basics, and try to implement a platform that can be used by all teams in the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be together with your manager to present the benefits of using the platform to the other managers.
You should be able to show them how the platform can help them to improve their processes and how it can help them to improve the way they are working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implemented successfully, it will save a ton of money for the company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>IOT - Intelligent Devices</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/iot-intelligent-devices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/iot-intelligent-devices/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/iot-intelligent-devices.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered that my vacuum robot stopped working for more than three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not configure the vacuuming program, that is, I could not modify the cleaning plan to define the rooms to be cleaned nor modify the suction power that the application allows you to set &lt;strong&gt;and you cannot do it in any other way&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="then"&gt;
Then?
&lt;a href="#then" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, you can turn the robot on with the button on the device itself and it will perform the last run it was configured to do. Hopefully it will be the entire house at sufficient suction power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days, the app started working again&amp;hellip; but this gave me pause. We rely on third-party services when we buy certain products, such as robot vacuums, smart plugs, surveillance cameras, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation there are &lt;em&gt;(mainly)&lt;/em&gt; two groups of people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common people&lt;/strong&gt; who do not have to know these details and buy this kind of devices because they like or need them.
They think they can be a good solution for them, but in this kind of situations, the only thing they can do is to call the store where they bought it or call the manufacturer to manage the warranty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer scientists&lt;/strong&gt; or those of us who like to solve technological problems and understand how this type of devices work, i.e. we know that they connect to a remote server to send/receive data &lt;em&gt;(which we don&amp;rsquo;t usually like)&lt;/em&gt; and that we need to interact with them from inside and outside the home through an application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="surveillance-cameras"&gt;
Surveillance cameras
&lt;a href="#surveillance-cameras" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These also apply to surveillance cameras. The common use of a surveillance camera is to be able to see what is happening in the house in real time from anywhere. In addition, upon any event/movement to receive security notifications. For this we rely, implicitly, on external services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are users aware of how this works? If they knew that the images pass through a server of a company &lt;em&gt;(which may or may not be the manufacturer of the product)&lt;/em&gt;, the content is analyzed and stored in the cloud, would they buy it? Would they use it? Would they install it at home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general public does not have to know this detail, for most it is just an application which configures the surveillance camera and magically you can see what happens in your home from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;magic does not exist&lt;/strong&gt;, on this we all agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="alternatives"&gt;
Alternatives
&lt;a href="#alternatives" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a group of affected &lt;em&gt;(on telegram)&lt;/em&gt; and it turns out I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one&amp;hellip;. The reason was that the servers of this brand went down and was out of service during that weekend completely.
In this telegram group I discovered that there was a way by which to set up a compatible server on my own. This way, I would be the only one responsible for keeping the service running so I could use my robot vacuum cleaner and be able to configure it without having to depend on that third party company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several hours of reading information and after studying &lt;em&gt;(not trivial)&lt;/em&gt; how to access and re-configure &lt;em&gt;(root)&lt;/em&gt; the robot to use this new method, I finally got it working.
All this is only feasible if you are a computer scientist and like this kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="future"&gt;
Future
&lt;a href="#future" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the general public I foresee legal problems with warranties, ie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if your robot vacuum cleaner stops working?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if it stops giving you certain functionality if a company&amp;rsquo;s server stops working?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the company goes bankrupt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;o&amp;hellip; any other reason that makes you unable to use that application to configure your device?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there some kind of law that mandates that you have to support and provide services for at least the life of the device?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What responsibility does the company have to maintain the server or that service beyond a year or two years from the sale of the product?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, we could get to a point where your device is a paperweight, right? &lt;strong&gt;Even if it&amp;rsquo;s in good shape&lt;/strong&gt;.
There may come a time when you can&amp;rsquo;t use your device at all because the company has stopped providing services and it all goes straight to the junkyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I foresee the following situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legislate to avoid these situations. It has loopholes:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you force a company outside the EU to provide service for the lifetime of a device?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to non-intelligent devices.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers will prefer to spend more money and have their device work regardless of whether the company goes bankrupt so they can fully enjoy their device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies dedicated to servicing these devices.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not usually economically viable/profitable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description></item><item><title>Social Networks and Society</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/social-networks-and-society.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social networks have been with us for more than &lt;strong&gt;two decades&lt;/strong&gt;. However, little education is being provided to our young people on how to use them responsibly. It is not just a &lt;em&gt;potential?&lt;/em&gt; problem for young people; the adult population will be faced with changing jobs, applying for a mortgage or a loan at a bank, or applying for a scholarship for their children&amp;hellip; all of these can be affected by the use of social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are not aware&lt;/strong&gt; of the amount of information we are sending, beyond a photo that may be innocent, to a social network that a priori should not share this information outside the platform, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="what-do-we-post-on-social-networks"&gt;
What do we post on social networks?
&lt;a href="#what-do-we-post-on-social-networks" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we post on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, we are not only posting the information we intend to share, but we are also giving away relevant information, such as: days you usually post photos, lifestyle habits/patterns, frequent locations, Are you currently working?&amp;hellip; even information about your personal, romantic or work relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no longer just the meme where you upload a photo and you&amp;rsquo;re at your friend&amp;rsquo;s house&amp;hellip; today your boss can see if you&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded a photo near a competitor&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an issue that does not have an easy solution because, at the end of the day, humans are social animals and as such, they seek acceptance by society. Sharing their experiences, their thoughts, their feelings on social networks seems to be the fastest way to achieve this acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id="black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality"&gt;
Black Mirror, dystopia or reality?
&lt;a href="#black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in &lt;a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror/seasons/3/episodes/1"&gt;Black mirror&lt;/a&gt;, the famous Netflix series, where one of the visions in which social networks take on a really dangerous protagonism was shown; it exposes a voting system where people rate your person and could leave you excluded from society if you do not receive enough positive votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you are not part of these social networks, you do not upload content or do not share your Christmas, vacation or travel photos&amp;hellip; it seems that you do nothing in your life. What about people who do not want to share, or do not know, or are not interested in sharing their life on social networks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could the day come when a humble, hardworking person, with demonstrable income, solvent, but who does not upload any type of content to any social network, is denied a loan for not having a minimum reputation in social networks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or even traveling&amp;hellip; at the borders. If the policeman/guard at the border cannot verify your person, since you have no presence on social networks&amp;hellip;. Would he let you enter the country? How will the absence of information be dealt with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information is power, everyone knows that, therefore, I can foresee certain socio/bureaucratic problems with people outside social networks that we will have to solve as a society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will they have to learn to share information about their life on social networks in order to travel? And if so&amp;hellip; Where will they get their information from? What will be their official source of information? If they were to make queries to platforms like Meta, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin and so on&amp;hellip;. How will they be able to verify that this data has not been altered by the companies themselves or if you have been hacked &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-many-users-facebook-losing"&gt;Who uses Facebook today?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; and they have posted content that is not legitimate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not a dystopia&lt;/strong&gt;, it is a reality that is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Layoffs at Meta</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/meta-layoffs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/meta-layoffs/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/meta-layoffs.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today has been known as one of the &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/"&gt;biggest layoffs in the history of technology&lt;/a&gt;; in this case, the lucky one, to call it somehow, has been &lt;a href="https://about.meta.com/es/meta/"&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is really hard news, it is more than eleven thousand employees, or what is the same, almost &lt;strong&gt;eleven thousand families&lt;/strong&gt; around the world. In recent weeks, we have seen other layoffs at Stripe, Uber, Twitter&amp;hellip; &lt;a href="https://layoffs.fyi/"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for these layoffs are motivated by the &lt;em&gt;post-pandemic?&lt;/em&gt; era. Let&amp;rsquo;s remember that during the pandemic, these services &lt;em&gt;(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Twitch&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em&gt; gained a lot of customers and relevance as they were one of the few entertainments we had during the confinements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we are facing what is possibly the third world war &lt;em&gt;(initiated by Russia&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em&gt;, a semiconductor crisis, an oligopoly in microchip manufacturing &lt;em&gt;(led by TSMC)&lt;/em&gt;, climate change, and extremist politics &lt;em&gt;(Italy)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us who work, in one way or another, in the technology world wonder if we are safe from these layoffs. We also wonder if it is particular to large technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there an oversizing of employees in these technology companies?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is my first post I would like to clarify that everything here is just personal opinions; I am not a researcher or a journalist at all. I simply give the vision of a *(non-)*engineer working in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id="does-this-mean-or-mean-that-a-technological-bubble-that-many-believe-exists-has-burst"&gt;
Does this mean or mean that a technological bubble that many believe exists has burst?
&lt;a href="#does-this-mean-or-mean-that-a-technological-bubble-that-many-believe-exists-has-burst" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;. If you look around you, absolutely everything is based on technology; from your washing machine, your phone, your TV, your smart speaker&amp;hellip; everything has a microprocessor with software that has to be maintained; both the embedded software and the services behind it. So I don&amp;rsquo;t think we are in a technological bubble, but rather a very complex global contingency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can only wait to see which will be the next company to have &amp;ldquo;massive&amp;rdquo; layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/about/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="-hello-world"&gt;
&amp;gt; Hello World,
&lt;a href="#-hello-world" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ten years of working in the technology sector, I have found the strength to write a blog. I am not writing but dictating &lt;em&gt;(this does not prevent me from editing the text and publishing the result)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog you won&amp;rsquo;t find either investigations or journalistic articles; I just want to share with the world opinions and personal experiences and be a reflection of what people who work &lt;em&gt;(or not)&lt;/em&gt; in the technological world can understand, share, feel and live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-reason"&gt;
The reason
&lt;a href="#the-reason" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main motivation to write is to keep a memory of what I am living, what I have learned, and how my personality is evolving over the following years. Something like a diary, without actually being a diary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="who-am-i"&gt;
Who am I?
&lt;a href="#who-am-i" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one, I mean, no one who stands out, neither for one thing or another. I recommend you not to pay too much attention to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="contact"&gt;
Contact
&lt;a href="#contact" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to contact me, feel free to fill out and send the following form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="contact-form-wrapper"&gt;
&lt;form class="contact-form" action="https://formsubmit.co/c2001a4d6f6f8cd3fab1ac412426173c" method="POST"&gt;
