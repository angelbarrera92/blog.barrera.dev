&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/iot-intelligent-devices.jpg"/>
&lt;p>I recently discovered that my vacuum robot stopped working for more than three days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could not configure the vacuuming program, that is, I could not modify the cleaning plan to define the rooms to be cleaned nor modify the suction power that the application allows you to set &lt;strong>and you cannot do it in any other way&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="then">
Then?
&lt;a href="#then" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Actually, you can turn the robot on with the button on the device itself and it will perform the last run it was configured to do. Hopefully it will be the entire house at sufficient suction power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few days, the app started working again&amp;hellip; but this gave me pause. We rely on third-party services when we buy certain products, such as robot vacuums, smart plugs, surveillance cameras, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this situation there are &lt;em>(mainly)&lt;/em> two groups of people:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Common people&lt;/strong> who do not have to know these details and buy this kind of devices because they like or need them.
They think they can be a good solution for them, but in this kind of situations, the only thing they can do is to call the store where they bought it or call the manufacturer to manage the warranty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Computer scientists&lt;/strong> or those of us who like to solve technological problems and understand how this type of devices work, i.e. we know that they connect to a remote server to send/receive data &lt;em>(which we don&amp;rsquo;t usually like)&lt;/em> and that we need to interact with them from inside and outside the home through an application.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h4 id="surveillance-cameras">
Surveillance cameras
&lt;a href="#surveillance-cameras" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>These also apply to surveillance cameras. The common use of a surveillance camera is to be able to see what is happening in the house in real time from anywhere. In addition, upon any event/movement to receive security notifications. For this we rely, implicitly, on external services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are users aware of how this works? If they knew that the images pass through a server of a company &lt;em>(which may or may not be the manufacturer of the product)&lt;/em>, the content is analyzed and stored in the cloud, would they buy it? Would they use it? Would they install it at home?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The general public does not have to know this detail, for most it is just an application which configures the surveillance camera and magically you can see what happens in your home from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But &lt;strong>magic does not exist&lt;/strong>, on this we all agree.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="alternatives">
Alternatives
&lt;a href="#alternatives" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I found a group of affected &lt;em>(on telegram)&lt;/em> and it turns out I wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one&amp;hellip;. The reason was that the servers of this brand went down and was out of service during that weekend completely.
In this telegram group I discovered that there was a way by which to set up a compatible server on my own. This way, I would be the only one responsible for keeping the service running so I could use my robot vacuum cleaner and be able to configure it without having to depend on that third party company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After several hours of reading information and after studying &lt;em>(not trivial)&lt;/em> how to access and re-configure &lt;em>(root)&lt;/em> the robot to use this new method, I finally got it working.
All this is only feasible if you are a computer scientist and like this kind of stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="future">
Future
&lt;a href="#future" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For the general public I foresee legal problems with warranties, ie:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What if your robot vacuum cleaner stops working?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if it stops giving you certain functionality if a company&amp;rsquo;s server stops working?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What if the company goes bankrupt?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>o&amp;hellip; any other reason that makes you unable to use that application to configure your device?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Is there some kind of law that mandates that you have to support and provide services for at least the life of the device?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If not&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>What responsibility does the company have to maintain the server or that service beyond a year or two years from the sale of the product?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, we could get to a point where your device is a paperweight, right? &lt;strong>Even if it&amp;rsquo;s in good shape&lt;/strong>.
There may come a time when you can&amp;rsquo;t use your device at all because the company has stopped providing services and it all goes straight to the junkyard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I foresee the following situations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Legislate to avoid these situations. It has loopholes:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How can you force a company outside the EU to provide service for the lifetime of a device?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Return to non-intelligent devices.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Consumers will prefer to spend more money and have their device work regardless of whether the company goes bankrupt so they can fully enjoy their device.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Companies dedicated to servicing these devices.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Not usually economically viable/profitable&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Social Networks and Society</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/social-networks-and-society/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/social-networks-and-society.jpg"/>
&lt;p>Social networks have been with us for more than &lt;strong>two decades&lt;/strong>. However, little education is being provided to our young people on how to use them responsibly. It is not just a &lt;em>potential?&lt;/em> problem for young people; the adult population will be faced with changing jobs, applying for a mortgage or a loan at a bank, or applying for a scholarship for their children&amp;hellip; all of these can be affected by the use of social networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We are not aware&lt;/strong> of the amount of information we are sending, beyond a photo that may be innocent, to a social network that a priori should not share this information outside the platform, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-do-we-post-on-social-networks">
What do we post on social networks?
&lt;a href="#what-do-we-post-on-social-networks" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>When we post on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook, we are not only posting the information we intend to share, but we are also giving away relevant information, such as: days you usually post photos, lifestyle habits/patterns, frequent locations, Are you currently working?&amp;hellip; even information about your personal, romantic or work relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s no longer just the meme where you upload a photo and you&amp;rsquo;re at your friend&amp;rsquo;s house&amp;hellip; today your boss can see if you&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded a photo near a competitor&amp;rsquo;s office.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is an issue that does not have an easy solution because, at the end of the day, humans are social animals and as such, they seek acceptance by society. Sharing their experiences, their thoughts, their feelings on social networks seems to be the fastest way to achieve this acceptance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality">
Black Mirror, dystopia or reality?
&lt;a href="#black-mirror-dystopia-or-reality" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>It was in &lt;a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/black-mirror/seasons/3/episodes/1">Black mirror&lt;/a>, the famous Netflix series, where one of the visions in which social networks take on a really dangerous protagonism was shown; it exposes a voting system where people rate your person and could leave you excluded from society if you do not receive enough positive votes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, if you are not part of these social networks, you do not upload content or do not share your Christmas, vacation or travel photos&amp;hellip; it seems that you do nothing in your life. What about people who do not want to share, or do not know, or are not interested in sharing their life on social networks?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Could the day come when a humble, hardworking person, with demonstrable income, solvent, but who does not upload any type of content to any social network, is denied a loan for not having a minimum reputation in social networks?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or even traveling&amp;hellip; at the borders. If the policeman/guard at the border cannot verify your person, since you have no presence on social networks&amp;hellip;. Would he let you enter the country? How will the absence of information be dealt with?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Information is power, everyone knows that, therefore, I can foresee certain socio/bureaucratic problems with people outside social networks that we will have to solve as a society.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Will they have to learn to share information about their life on social networks in order to travel? And if so&amp;hellip; Where will they get their information from? What will be their official source of information? If they were to make queries to platforms like Meta, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin and so on&amp;hellip;. How will they be able to verify that this data has not been altered by the companies themselves or if you have been hacked &lt;em>(&lt;a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-many-users-facebook-losing">Who uses Facebook today?&lt;/a>)&lt;/em> and they have posted content that is not legitimate?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It is not a dystopia&lt;/strong>, it is a reality that is just around the corner.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Layoffs at Meta</title><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/meta-layoffs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/posts/meta-layoffs/</guid><description>
&lt;img src="https://blog.barrera.dev/images/meta-layoffs.jpg"/>
&lt;p>Today has been known as one of the &lt;a href="(https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/)">biggest layoffs in the history of technology&lt;/a>; in this case, the lucky one, to call it somehow, has been &lt;a href="https://about.meta.com/es/meta/">meta&lt;/a>, commonly known as &lt;strong>Facebook&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is really hard news, it is more than eleven thousand employees, or what is the same, almost &lt;strong>eleven thousand families&lt;/strong> around the world. In recent weeks, we have seen other layoffs at Stripe, Uber, Twitter&amp;hellip; &lt;a href="https://layoffs.fyi/">source&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reasons for these layoffs are motivated by the &lt;em>post-pandemic?&lt;/em> era. Let&amp;rsquo;s remember that during the pandemic, these services &lt;em>(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Twitch&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em> gained a lot of customers and relevance as they were one of the few entertainments we had during the confinements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, we are facing what is possibly the third world war &lt;em>(initiated by Russia&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em>, a semiconductor crisis, an oligopoly in microchip manufacturing &lt;em>(led by TSMC)&lt;/em>, climate change, and extremist politics &lt;em>(Italy)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of us who work, in one way or another, in the technology world wonder if we are safe from these layoffs. We also wonder if it is particular to large technology companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Is there an oversizing of employees in these technology companies?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Since this is my first post I would like to clarify that everything here is just personal opinions; I am not a researcher or a journalist at all. I simply give the vision of a *(non-)*engineer working in this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="does-this-mean-or-mean-that-a-technological-bubble-that-many-believe-exists-has-burst">
Does this mean or mean that a technological bubble that many believe exists has burst?
&lt;a href="#does-this-mean-or-mean-that-a-technological-bubble-that-many-believe-exists-has-burst" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I would say &lt;strong>no&lt;/strong>. If you look around you, absolutely everything is based on technology; from your washing machine, your phone, your TV, your smart speaker&amp;hellip; everything has a microprocessor with software that has to be maintained; both the embedded software and the services behind it. So I don&amp;rsquo;t think we are in a technological bubble, but rather a very complex global contingency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can only wait to see which will be the next company to have &amp;ldquo;massive&amp;rdquo; layoffs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.barrera.dev/en/about/</guid><description>

&lt;p>After ten years of working in the technology sector, I have found the strength to write a blog. I am not writing but dictating &lt;em>(this does not prevent me from editing the text and publishing the result)&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog you won&amp;rsquo;t find either investigations or journalistic articles; I just want to share with the world opinions and personal experiences and be a reflection of what people who work &lt;em>(or not)&lt;/em> in the technological world can understand, share, feel and live.&lt;/p>
