Today has been known as one of the [biggest layoffs in the history of technology]((https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/mark-zuckerberg-layoff-message-to-employees/)); in this case, the lucky one, to call it somehow, has been [meta](https://about.meta.com/es/meta/), commonly known as **Facebook**.

It is really hard news, it is more than eleven thousand employees, or what is the same, almost **eleven thousand families** around the world. In recent weeks, we have seen other layoffs at Stripe, Uber, Twitter... [source](https://layoffs.fyi/).

The reasons for these layoffs are motivated by the *post-pandemic?* era. Let's remember that during the pandemic, these services *(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Twitch...)* gained a lot of customers and relevance as they were one of the few entertainments we had during the confinements.

In addition, we are facing what is possibly the third world war *(initiated by Russia...)*, a semiconductor crisis, an oligopoly in microchip manufacturing *(led by TSMC)*, climate change, and extremist politics *(Italy)*.

All of us who work, in one way or another, in the technology world wonder if we are safe from these layoffs. We also wonder if it is particular to large technology companies.

*Is there an oversizing of employees in these technology companies?*

#### Does this mean or mean that a technological bubble that many believe exists has burst?

I would say **no**. If you look around you, absolutely everything is based on technology; from your washing machine, your phone, your TV, your smart speaker... everything has a microprocessor with software that has to be maintained; both the embedded software and the services behind it. So I don't think we are in a technological bubble, but rather a very complex global contingency.

We can only wait to see which will be the next company to have "massive" layoffs.
