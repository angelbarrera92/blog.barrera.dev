## > Hello World,

After ten years of working in the technology sector, I have found the strength to write a blog. I am not writing but dictating *(this does not prevent me from editing the text and publishing the result)*.

In this blog you won't find either investigations or journalistic articles; I just want to share with the world opinions and personal experiences and be a reflection of what people who work *(or not)* in the technological world can understand, share, feel and live.

### The reason

The main motivation to write is to keep a memory of what I am living, what I have learned, and how my personality is evolving over the following years. Something like a diary, without actually being a diary.

### Who am I?

No one, I mean, no one who stands out, neither for one thing or another. I recommend you not to pay too much attention to me.

### Contact

`TODO`: Add here some kind of contact/calendly form so they can contact me.
